# PurchAIs - The Cognitive Kitchen OS 🥬🤖

**Built for the Google DeepMind "Vibe Coding" Hackathon (Gemini 3 Pro).**

PurchAIs is an intelligent, multimodal grocery assistant designed to reduce household food waste by closing the loop between inventory tracking, consumption, and restocking.

## 💡 The Concept
Modern fridges are smart, but they lack reasoning. PurchAIs fills this gap by acting as a "Kitchen Operating System" that visually understands what you have and logically suggests how to use it before it spoils.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Multimodal Ingestion:** Simulates processing video feeds of an open fridge to identify ingredients and freshness levels.
* **Contextual Reasoning:** The "AI Chef" doesn't just list recipes; it solves the "Knapsack Problem" for your pantry, prioritizing expiring items.
* **Automated Logistics:** Real-time inventory state management. If an ingredient is used (cooked) and drops below a user-defined threshold, it is automatically added to the restock queue.

## 🤖 Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 Pro
This entire application was built using a **"Vibe Coding"** workflow in Google AI Studio.
* **Architect:** Gemini 3 Pro (Generated ~95% of the code).
* **Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Lucide React.
* **Methodology:** Iterative prompting to build the Dashboard, Inventory Logic, and Mock Services.

## 📦 Usage
This project is a high-fidelity prototype designed to showcase the UX/UI paradigm of future AI kitchen assistants.
