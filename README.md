# PurchAIs - The Cognitive Kitchen OS

**Built for the Google DeepMind "Vibe Coding" Hackathon (Gemini 3 Pro).**

PurchAIs is an intelligent, multimodal grocery assistant designed to reduce food waste.

## 🤖 How it was built
This entire application (React + Tailwind + Logic) was "Vibe Coded" using **Gemini 3 Pro** in Google AI Studio. The focus was on leveraging Gemini's reasoning to solve the "Household Knapsack Problem"—optimizing pantry usage before expiration.

## 🚀 Features
* **Multimodal Ingestion:** Simulating fridge video analysis.
* **Contextual Reasoning:** AI Chef that suggests recipes based on *expiring* inventory.
* **Automated Logistics:** Auto-restock thresholds connected to retailer APIs (Simulated).
